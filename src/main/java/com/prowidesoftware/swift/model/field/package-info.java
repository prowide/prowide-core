/**
 * Base package for classes that model SWIFT MT message fields.
 *
 * <p>This package provides classes to parse and model every possible field and letter option of a SWIFT MT message.
 *
 * <p>The constructor of each field class accepts the field's literal value and parses its content into a list of components with a simple and generic API of getComponent1() ... getComponentN().<br>
 * Components are modeled as string, but if the component represents a date or number, additional API is provided to get the component parsed into a Calendar and Number with methods like getComponent1AsCalendar() and getComponent3AsNumber().
