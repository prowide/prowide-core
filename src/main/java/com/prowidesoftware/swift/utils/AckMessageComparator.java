/**
 * A {@link SwiftMessageComparator} tailored for typical ACK matching using the full original message copy.
 *
 * <p>Compares all values from block 1 2 3 and 4, ignoring session and sequence number in block1. The trailer block 5
 * if present in any of the messages is also ignored. Regarding multiline fields the EOL must be an exact match
 * (meaning CRLF is not the same as just LF). And for block 2 Input, the optional fields for the Delivery Monitoring
 * and Obsolescence Period are ignored during comparison.
 *
 * <p>For ACK matching based on the MUR, see {@link MurMessageComparator}
